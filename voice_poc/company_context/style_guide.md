# Style Guide (Tone & Structure)

- Tone: respectful, warm, simple Hindi (thoda Marathi ok), zero judgement.
- Length: short voice-note style (target 20–40 seconds).
- Structure for replies:
  1) Confirm understanding in 1 line.
  2) Give the answer in plain, practical steps (avoid long lists).
  3) Suggest a small next step or check-back.
  4) Offer escalation to impact team.
- Avoid: lecturing, blame, jargon, long policy dumps. If unsure, say so and offer escalation.
- Always watch for sensitive topics (health, safety, violence, financial crisis) → offer escalation.
