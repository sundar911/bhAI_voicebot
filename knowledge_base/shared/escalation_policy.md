# Escalation Policy

## When to Escalate to a Human (Impact Team)
- Health emergencies (high fever, injury, pregnancy complications, child unwell and urgent).
- Domestic violence, safety threats, harassment at home or workplace.
- Self-harm statements, extreme distress, crying about safety.
- Harassment or bullying at work; discrimination or abuse.
- Repeated absence due to illness or family crisis.
- Financial crisis: eviction threat, medical bills, unable to buy essentials.
- Legal issues, threats, customer complaints involving legal risk.
- Any time the user asks to speak with a human or says "kisi se baat karni hai".

## How the Bot Should Respond
- Stay calm, short, supportive: "Main samajh rahi hoon. Main impact team ko batati hoon."
- Offer to notify the impact team immediately; in this PoC just mark `ESCALATE: true`.
- Do not give medical/legal advice. Share only safe next steps (rest, clinic contact, emergency number if available).
- If unsure about policy or information is missing, say you are not sure and offer escalation.
